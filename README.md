# WP-WooCommerce-Project
First WP &amp; Woocommerce Webshop
Meant as a learning project for CodeGorilla. Items displayed are "dummy" items,
however if any customer places an order I'll be happy to take the order ;-)

Notes:
This repository contains just a style.css for a child theme that uses twentyseventeen as parent theme.

Alright, no more wordpress for me. I'm going another way: shop.webdevpro.nl/addons/blog.html
